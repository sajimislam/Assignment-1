            <p>Based on the process of web development, a web developer is a programmer that creates web-based
                applications
                to be accessed through the Internet. These websites and apps have specific features and functions that
                the
                dev is responsible to build through his programming skills.</p>

                <p>A vision statement is the anchor point of any strategic plan. It outlines what an organization would
                    like to ultimately achieve and gives purpose to the existence of the organization.</p>

                <p>A website should exist primarily as a means for growth. It should leverage the business by serving as
                    a tool to meet big picture business goals. For years, the purpose of a website has been to tell
                    people about your business.</p>

            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
                (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was
                confirmed to have spread to Bangladesh in March 2020. The first three known cases were reported on 8
                March 2020 by the country's epidemiology institute, IEDCR. Since then, the pandemic has spread day by
                day over the whole nation and the number of affected people has been increasing. Bangladesh is the
                second most affected country in South Asia, after India.
